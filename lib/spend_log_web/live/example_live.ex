  ⚠️  EXAMPLE PAGE — DELETE ME.

  A throwaway reference showing the LiveView ↔ LiveVue ↔ Nuxt UI form pattern this template is built
  around. It is wired to `/` only so a fresh scaffold renders something real.

  When you build your first feature, **delete this file and `assets/vue/ExampleForm.vue`** and point
  `/` (in `router.ex`) at your own LiveView. Nothing else depends on these two files.

  Patterns to copy (they recur in every feature — this is why the example exists):

    * `connected?/1`-guarded data loading — Iron Law #1: no DB queries in the disconnected mount.
    * `to_vue_form/1` — normalize a form before it becomes a Vue prop (see `LiveVueHelpers`); an
      `AshPhoenix.Form` create form has `data: nil` and crashes LiveVue SSR without it.
    * the `"validate"` / `"submit"` event round-trip, driven from the Vue island.
    * binding Nuxt UI inputs to `useLiveForm` fields — see `ExampleForm.vue`.

  A real feature backs the form with `AshPhoenix.Form` instead of the plain in-memory `to_form/2`
  used here — the LiveView shape is identical, only the form *source* differs. The `# with Ash:`
  comments mark the exact seams.
